# Ashleys-Chore-Helper

Chore Dice is a React-based web application designed to randomly select chores based on assigned weights. It helps users distribute tasks fairly and adds a fun element of randomness to daily chores.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with names and assign weights to them, indicating the frequency or importance of the task.
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a table with options to mark as completed or to remove them.
- **Roll**: Users can roll to randomly select a task based on the weights assigned. Tasks marked as completed will not be considered in the roll.
- **Mark as Complete**: Tasks can be toggled as completed, which will show a checkmark next to the task and exclude it from future rolls.
